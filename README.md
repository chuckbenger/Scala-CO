Conquer online private server built for patch 4267.

Technologies:
- Scala (Functional programming language running on the JVM)
- Akka (Actor library)
- Slick (ORM)
- Spray (Library for building high performance network applications)
- MySQL

The server is designed using the Actor model. This model makes building highly concurrent applications much easier. All objects (Actors) communicate with each other by sending messages to one another.

Currently the server has the following features developed:
- Login
- Interacting with other players
- Trading
- Warehouse
- NPC Scripting system
- Buying & Selling to NPCs
- DMap loading
- Mob spawning
- Basic monster AI
- Basic stat calculations
- Attack monsters
- Portals
- Dropping/Picking up items from the world
